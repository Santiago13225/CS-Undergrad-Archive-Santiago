Devout and Diverse voice strong support for the social safety net and further action on racial equality. However, they take more conservative views than their fellow Democratic-leaning groups on a number of issues including global engagement, views of business and attitudes on homosexuality and immigrants. Devout and Diverse are defined, in part, by their faith: Most say that it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values.","colors":["#CDDBDE","#e5f3f7","#456a84"],"percentPublic":"9","areaChart":[0,0.03,0.13,0.37,0.5,0.81,0.69,1,1.16,1.02,0.95,0.87,0.49,0.47,0.23,0.17,0.08,0.05,0,0,0],"navOrder":4,"abbr":"Dv","questions":{"q1":{"The government should do more to help needy Americans, even if it means going deeper into debt":[62],"The government today can't afford to do much more to help the needy":[34]},"q2":{"Government is almost always wasteful and inefficient":[49],"Government often does a better job than people give it credit for":[47]},"q3":{"The best way to ensure peace is through military strength":[32],"Good diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace":[66]},"q4":{"Racial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can't get ahead these days":[41],"Black people who can't get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition":[47]},"q5":{"Government regulation of business is necessary to protect the public interest":[38],"Government regulation of business usually does more harm than good":[55]},"q6":{"Homosexuality should be accepted by society":[53],"Homosexuality should be discouraged by society":[37]},"q7":{"Business corporations make too much profit":[50],"Most corporations make a fair and reasonable amount of profit":[43]},"q8":{"Stricter environmental laws and regulations cost too many jobs and hurt the economy":[45],"Stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost":[48]},"q9":{"Immigrants today strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents":[47],"Immigrants today are a burden on our country because they take our jobs, housing and health care":[44]},"q10":{"Poor people today have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything in return":[10],"Poor people have hard lives because government benefits don't go far enough to help them live decently":[86]},"q11":{"The economic system in this country unfairly favors powerful interests":[55],"The economic system in this country is generally fair to most Americans":[43]},"q12":{"Our country has made the changes needed to give black people equal rights with white people":[8],"Our country needs to continue making changes to give black people equal rights with white people":[89]},"q13":{"It's best for the future of our country to be active in world affairs":[22],"We should pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate on problems here at home":[69]},"q14":{"Most people who want to get ahead can make it if they're willing to work hard":[47],"Hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people":[48]},"q15":{"The obstacles that once made it harder for women than men to get ahead are now largely gone":[32],"There are still significant obstacles that make it harder for women to get ahead than men":[64]},"q16":{"In foreign policy, the U.S. should take into account the interests of its allies even if it means making compromises with them":[26],"In foreign policy, the U.S. should follow its OWN national interests even when its allies strongly disagree":[64]}}},"cluster_5":{"score":-15.878408325337404,"name":"New Era Enterprisers","description":"This relatively young, economically conservative, Republican-leaning group tends to be relatively moderate on immigration and views about America\u2019s engagement with the rest of the world.
