Core Conservatives are deeply skeptical of the social safety net and favor lower tax rates on corporations and high-income individuals. While they are divided on whether immigrants do more to strengthen or burden the country, Core Conservatives offer far more positive views of immigrants than do Country First Conservatives. Core Conservatives are relatively upbeat about national conditions and a majority says that the United States “stands above” all other nations in the world.</p></div><div class="key"><p>Compare your answers with results from our national survey:</p><ul><li><span></span>Core Conservatives</li><li><span></span>General public</li></ul></div></div><div class="cluster-text" data-cluster="cluster_7" style="display:none;"><div class="description"><p>This largely Republican group is highly critical of immigration and U.S. global involvement. Country First Conservatives are most likely to describe immigrants as a burden on the country and to say that too much openness threatens American identity. More than any other group, they say that America should act in its own interest even when its foreign allies disagree. Like Core Conservatives, they prefer a smaller government with fewer services, and most think that government is wasteful and inefficient. Country First Conservatives are conservative on social issues and are the only typology group in which a majority says homosexuality should be discouraged by society.</p></div><div class="key"><p>Compare your answers with results from our national survey:</p><ul><li><span></span>Country First Conservatives</li><li><span></span>General public</li></ul></div></div><div class="cluster-text" data-cluster="cluster_6" style="display:none;"><div class="description"><p>Critical of many major institutions and government, Market Skeptic Republicans mostly identify with, or lean toward, the GOP. They stand out from other Republican-oriented groups in their negative views of the economic system: An overwhelming majority say it “unfairly favors powerful interests.” Most also say businesses make too much profit, and they are the most likely Republican-leaning group to want to raise taxes on corporations (55%). They are similar to other GOP-leaning groups in their skepticism about the social safety net.</p></div><div class="key"><p>Compare your answers with results from our national survey:</p><ul><li><span></span>Market Skeptic Republicans</li><li><span></span>General public</li></ul></div></div><div class="cluster-text" data-cluster="cluster_5" style="display:none;"><div class="description"><p>This relatively young, economically conservative, Republican-leaning group tends to be relatively moderate on immigration and views about America’s engagement with the rest of the world. Most say U.S. involvement in the global economy is a good thing and that immigrants strengthen the nation. As is the case with other GOP-leaning groups, a majority of New Era Enterprisers reject the idea that racial discrimination is the main reason many black people are unable to get ahead.  Nearly two-thirds favor societal acceptance of homosexuality. New Era Enterprisers are less critical about government than other Republican-leaning groups.</p></div><div class="key"><p>Compare your answers with results from our national survey:</p><ul><li><span></span>New Era Enterprisers</li><li><span></span>General public</li></ul></div></div><div class="cluster-text" data-cluster="cluster_4" style="display:none;"><div class="description"><p>This racially and ethnically diverse group is less politically homogenous than most other typology groups, though a 59% majority associates with the Democratic Party. Devout and Diverse voice strong support for the social safety net and further action on racial equality. However, they take more conservative views than their fellow Democratic-leaning groups on a number of issues including global engagement, views of business and attitudes on homosexuality and immigrants. Devout and Diverse are defined, in part, by their faith: Most say that it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values.</p></div><div class="key"><p>Compare your answers with results from our national survey:</p><ul><li><span></span>Devout and Diverse</li><li><span></span>General public</li></ul></div></div><div class="cluster-text" data-cluster="cluster_3" style="display:none;"><div class="description"><p>This majority-minority group mostly identifies as Democratic or leans toward the Democratic Party. Disaffected Democrats strongly believe the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests and that business corporations make too much profit. Relatively few believe their family has achieved the American Dream, and 24% believe it is out of reach for their family. Most say the government should do more to help the needy and that poor people have hard lives because government benefits do not go far enough to help them live decently. In contrast to other Democratic-oriented groups, a majority (63%) characterizes government as “almost always wasteful and inefficient.”</p></div><div class="key"><p>Compare your answers with results from our national survey:</p><ul><li><span></span>Disaffected Democrats</li><li><span></span>General public</li></ul></div></div><div class="cluster-text" data-cluster="cluster_2" style="display:none;"><div class="description"><p>Democratic-leaning and financially comfortable, Opportunity Democrats have liberal attitudes on most issues including the environment, immigration and homosexuality.

They back a robust role for government and are strong advocates of the social safety net. Large majorities view the current economic system as unfair and see economic inequality as a major problem. They take broadly positive views of immigrants, and fully 99% think being open to people from around the world is an essential part of the nation’s identity. Most say more needs to be done to address both racial discrimination and obstacles to women’s achievement. They support same-sex marriage and believe homosexuality should be accepted by society.

The Center has taken measures to ensure that the Data is devoid of information that could be used to identify individuals (including, but not limited to, names, telephone numbers and email addresses) who participated in or who were the subject of any research surveys or studies used to collect the Data (\u201cPersonally Identifying Information\u201d). However, in the event that you discover any such Personally Identifying Information in the Data, you shall immediately notify the Center and refrain from using any such Personally Identifying Information.

The parties agree that any breach of the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement by User will result in irreparable damage to the Center for which it will have no adequate remedy at law.  Therefore, it is agreed that the Center shall be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction enjoining any such breach by any court of competent jurisdiction.  Such injunction shall be without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which the Center may be entitled, including but not limited to any damages resulting from User\u2019s breach of the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.  Any failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall not operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n\tC.\tUser will immediately notify the Center and cooperate with investigations, and provide any information reasonably requested by the Center if User knows of or suspects any breach of security or potential vulnerability of the Data and will promptly remedy such breach.\n\n\tIV.\tIndemnification. User shall indemnify and hold harmless the Center, its affiliates and related organizations, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, legal representatives, agents, successors and assigns, from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and professionals\u2019 fees and court costs arising out of any third-party claims based on (a) User\u2019s access or use of the Data; (b) any changes made by User to the Data in accordance with this Agreement; or (c) any breach by User of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n\tV.\tTermination.
