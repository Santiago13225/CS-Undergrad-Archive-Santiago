        "We found a dataset that we felt was sufficiently good enough for preprocessing within Kaggle. In this case, our chosen dataset was regarding the Titanic and its passengers. All we had to do was manually re-engineer it a bit so that we could work with it. Here, you can find the dataset from the link posted below:\n",

        "Our dataset was already pretty well set for preprocessing in that it had many missing values and outliers in it, so it had something we could work on. One thing we could still do was manually add in duplicate values, so one of our team members went ahead and manually added 50 duplicate rows at random, just so that we can get started and continue with the project.\n",

This makes it more difficult to find outliers and makes it harder to cluster more relevant data. Dimensionality reduction helps with decreasing the sparsity of data, reducing the density of data, and helping with better visualization of data. One of the main techniques for dimensionality reduction is Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",

        "When we worked on preprocessing, we felt that it would be necessary to deal with duplicates, missing values, and with unnecessary columns first because we felt it would save time and processing power for the later steps if we can make our data easier to understand and easier to work with. We then decided to get rid of certain outliers for the same reason (*although we split the dataframe into three groups). After that, we would combine the dataframes and then perform the rest of the steps, which we felt would benefit from being executed with a smaller and cleaner dataframe. This was how we determined the order in which to do things.\n",
