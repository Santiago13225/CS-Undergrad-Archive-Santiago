Below are the details of the lab machine used to generate the .jar file and test the assignment:

Charlie - RVR5029
ECS-PAPERBOY

Additional Notes:
This project was by far the hardest. I really tried my best to get everything working perfectly
, but I got overwhelmed. Regardless, I really enjoyed this class and everything it had to offer.
I honestly don't think I will do the extra credit assignment, so this might be it for me.
